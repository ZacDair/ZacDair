### Zachary Dair, BSc (Hons) Software Development

I'm Zac Dair, Advance CRT PhD Candidate. I recently (June 2021) attained a first class honors for my bachelors degree in software development in Munster Technological University.
My main areas of interest are AI, Game Development, Machine and Deep Learning, NLP and Contextual Analysis.

Currently I'm exploring the research domain of affective computing, more specifically emotion detection from speech in a bi-modal manner.
I co-authored a paper for the [ISSC 2021](https://www.issc.ie/) conference, which can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/351819836_Classification_of_Emotive_Expression_Using_Verbal_and_Non_Verbal_Components_of_Speech), and is currently being expanded to aid my PhD research.

In the past I have worked as a customer support agent, as a computer science tutor, and as an software development intern in McKesson (Fortune 7 Company).
I have also began setting the foundations for my passion project, my own game development company, which I hope to grow and develop fully after I finish my studies.
