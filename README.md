I'm Zac Dair, Advance CRT PhD student. I have a bachelors (hons) degree in software development, first class honors, from Munster Technological University.
My main areas of interest are AI, Psychophysiology, Affective Computing, HCI and Game Development.

Currently I'm exploring the research domain of Affective Computing, I've dabbled in aspects of emotion recognition from speech.
More information on that can be found in my publications - [ISSC 2021](https://www.issc.ie/) and [AICS 2021](http://aics2021.ucd.ie/)  
The research I am currently focused on the usage of physiological signals for increasing the personalization of healthcare with wearable technology.  

In the past I have worked as a customer support agent, as a computer science tutor, and as an software development intern in McKesson (Fortune 7 Company).
